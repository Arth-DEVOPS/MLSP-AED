# MLSP-AED
Refer to "Report_Classification_SEAD.pdf" and "Report_Tagging_MEAD.pdf" in the repository for details about the project and methods used.
The aim of the project was to use machine learning models for classifying (to perform single event audio detection) and tagging (multiple event audio detection) on audio datasets. The dataset was given in the form of mel spectrograms.
